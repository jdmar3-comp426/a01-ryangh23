            <p>Zeus, the God of Sky and Thunder, is a central figure in Greek mythology.
                He rules as king of the gods at Mount Olympus. His symbols include the thunderbolt,
                the eagle, the bull, and the oak tree. To become king of the gods, he overthrew his 
                father, Cronus, and freed his siblings.
