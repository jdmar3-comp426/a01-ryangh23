                Zeus' father was a Titan named Cronus. Cronus was the leader and youngest of the
                first generation of Titans. He overthrew his father Uranus and ruled until
                he was overthrown by Zeus.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zeus' mother was a Titan named Rhea. She was known as the mother of the gods. In order
                to protect Zeus from being swallowed by Cronus, she birthed Zeus in a cave on the island
                Crete and gave Cronus a stone wrapped in a cloth instead.
